Artillery[WARN]: [!] Insecure configuration detected on filesystem: [!] Issue identified: /etc/ssh/sshd_config. SSH is running on the default port 22. An attacker commonly scans for these type of ports. Recommendation: Change the port to something high that doesn't get picked up by typical port scanners.


[!] Issue identified: Password authentication enabled. An attacker may be able to brute force weak passwords.


Issue identified: /var/www/html/DVWA/config/config.inc.php.bak permissions are not set to root. If an attacker compromises the system and is running under the Apache user account, could view these files. Recommendation: Change the permission of /var/www/html/DVWA/config/config.inc.php.bak to root:root. Command: chown root:root /var/www/html/DVWA/config/config.inc.php.bak
